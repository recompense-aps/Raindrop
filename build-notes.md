# BUILD NOTES - 0.0.7

## Highlights
-   Added the ability to "tweak the dials". Check out
    the file 'raindrop.settings.' In it you can configure
    some of the behavior in the game

-   Added new setting "FreeFall.SpawnInterval" use this to control how often
    obstacles are spawned. (Obstacles are spawned just off screen by default)

-   Added new setting 'FreeFall.DropScale" use this to control the initial size
    of the drop.

-   UI looks a little different, switched to using Godot's built in UI tools 
    instead of my ad hoc solution.
